%   RandomSample : A function that returns a random sample in freespace
%
%   Dist : A function that computes the distance between a given point in
%        configuration space and all of the entries in an array of samples
%
%   LocalPlanner :  A function that determines whether there is a collision
%        free straight line path between two points in configuration space
%
%   nsamples : The number of random samples to generate
%
%   k : The number of neighbors that should be considered in
%        forming the roadmap graph.
